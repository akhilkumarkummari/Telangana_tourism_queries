1) List down the top 10 districts that have the highest number of domestic visitors overall (2016-2019)?

code:- 
SELECT district, SUM(visitors) AS total_visitors
FROM tourism_project.domestic_visitors
WHERE year BETWEEN 2016 AND 2019
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY total_visitors DESC
LIMIT 10;

2) List down the top 3 districts based on compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of visitors between (2016-2019)?

code:- 
SELECT 
  district,
  SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2016' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END) AS start_values,
  SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2019' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END) AS end_values,
  POWER((SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2019' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END)/
         SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2016' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END)), 1/3) - 1 AS CAGR
FROM tourism_project.domestic_visitors
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY CAGR DESC
LIMIT 3;

3) List down the bottom 3 districts based on compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of visitors between (2016-2019)? (Insight: Districts that are declining)

code: -
SELECT 
  district,
  SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2016' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END) AS start_values,
  SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2019' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END) AS end_values,
  POWER((SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2019' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END)/
         SUM(CASE WHEN year = '2016' THEN visitors ELSE 0 END)), 1/3) - 1 AS CAGR
FROM tourism_project.domestic_visitors
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY CAGR ASC
LIMIT 3;

4) What are the peak and low season months for Hyderabad based on the data from 2016 to 2019 for Hyderabad district?

SELECT 
  year,
  month,
  SUM(visitors) AS total_visitors
FROM 
  tourism_project.domestic_visitors
WHERE 
  district = 'Hyderabad'
  GROUP BY 
  month
ORDER BY 
  total_visitors DESC
  limit 5;
  
5) Show the top & bottom 3 districts with high domestic to foreign tourist ratio? (Insight: Government can learn from top districts and replicate the same to bottom districts which can improve the foreign visitors as foreign visitors will bring more revenue)

code: -
SELECT d.district,
sum(d.visitors) as total_domestic,
concat(ROUND((SUM(d.visitors) / (SUM(d.visitors) + SUM(f.visitors))) * 100, 2),
        '% domestic, ',
ROUND((SUM(f.visitors) / (SUM(d.visitors) + SUM(f.visitors))) * 100, 2),
        '% foreign'
    ) AS percentage,
sum(f.visitors) as total_foreign,
round(sum(d.visitors)/sum(f.visitors),2) as ratio
FROM 
  tourism_project.domestic_visitors as d
JOIN tourism_project.foreign_visitors as f ON
d.district	= f.district
group by d. district
order by ratio DESC
limit 3;

b. SELECT d.district,
sum(d.visitors) as total_domestic,
concat(ROUND((SUM(d.visitors) / (SUM(d.visitors) + SUM(f.visitors))) * 100, 2),
        '% domestic, ',
ROUND((SUM(f.visitors) / (SUM(d.visitors) + SUM(f.visitors))) * 100, 2),
        '% foreign'
    ) AS percentage,
sum(f.visitors) as total_foreign,
round(sum(d.visitors)/sum(f.visitors),2) as ratio
FROM 
  tourism_project.domestic_visitors as d
JOIN tourism_project.foreign_visitors as f ON
d.district	= f.district
group by d. district
order by ratio ASC
limit 3;

5) List the top & bottom 5 districts based on 'population to tourist footfall ratio" ratio in 2019?

code: -

SELECT 
    dm.district,d.year,
    SUM(d.visitors + f.visitors) as Total_visitors,
    SUM(dm.Total) AS Total_population,
    SUM(d.visitors + f.visitors) / SUM(dm.Total) AS ratio
FROM 
    tourism_project.domestic_visitors AS d 
    LEFT JOIN tourism_project.foreign_visitors AS f 
        ON d.district = f.district
    LEFT JOIN tourism_project.demographics AS dm 
        ON d.district = dm.district        
WHERE 
    d.year = '2019' AND f.year = '2019'
GROUP BY 
    dm.district
ORDER BY 
    ratio DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    
    b. SELECT 
    dm.district,d.year,
    SUM(d.visitors + f.visitors) as Total_visitors,
    SUM(dm.Total) AS Total_population,
    SUM(d.visitors + f.visitors) / SUM(dm.Total) AS ratio

    LEFT JOIN tourism_project.foreign_visitors AS f 
        ON d.district = f.district
    LEFT JOIN tourism_project.demographics AS dm 
        ON d.district = dm.district        
WHERE 
    d.year = '2019' AND f.year = '2019'
GROUP BY 
    dm.district
ORDER BY 
    ratio ASC
    LIMIT 5;
